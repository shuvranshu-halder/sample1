		<p>A lot of students complain that throughout theirstudy at school and college they haven’t learnt the thing they were supposed to be doing all that time, namely – studying. And it is sad to admit, but to a certain degree it is true – educational institutions deal with a lot of subjects, but they rarely manage to teach this one thing. Thus, a student has to help himself on his own.</p>

		<p>At present situations, studying will help you rise above and lead others to the goal of positivity and improvement. If you study and work hard, it will help you gain high qualifications in your academic field so that both your health and wealth is generous and rich till your life ends, and you will be remembered even after that.</p>
		<p>Self-studying is a great method students can use to enhance their learning experience, whether they are studying for a course or learning about a topic for fun.

		Using self-study, students are able to go beyond simply learning what their class textbooks and instructors teach them. By practicing self-study, they are encouraged to further explore topics they are interested in, developing stronger study skills as a result.

		One of the major advantages of self-study is that students can take control over their own learning. And when students have control, they become even more interested in learning.</p>
