		<p>Our class room is the one of the best place in our life. We all play,eat,talk good things. We can't forget our class room ever. We fight and become Friends and it is a place were we all make jokes. The best place to find Friends and best friends. In any festive we decorate our class very nice. We all share food. We all cry in first day of school when we are small but class make us feel happy. So it is one of the best place. It is the best world filled with happiness.</p>
		<p>It‘s infect, in the class room that a student’s personality is really formed. It is for this reason that I in the class- room most attentively. It is only the foolish few who sometimes spoil the real taste of studies as they cannot appreciate the value of studies and have to repent later in life</p>
